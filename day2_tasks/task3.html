        <b>Short Speech about Nature</b><br>
        <b>G</b>ood morning everyone and all present here. <i>I am standing before you all to share my thoughts about
            through my
            speech about nature</i>. <q> Nature is the world around us</q>. We, all human beings depend on nature every
        time and
        for
        everything. Many people admire the beauty of nature and even they write many novels and poems on it, this is
        because the beauty of nature cannot be expressed in one single word or saying. It provides the humans,
        animals
        and all the living beings on the earth a place to live with the joy of natural resources.
        <q> <strong>Nature- A Boon for All</strong></q>
        Nature is the mother of all, as it helps to sustain our life. <del>It is our companion since eternity</del>.
        Despite
        the
        <u> importance of nature in human life</u>, we are spoiling its balance only due to our greediness.<em> Millions
            of
            years
            ago, when the knowledge of man was not better than an animal</em>. At that time man used to get all the
        things
        needed
        for life only from nature. Even today, at the heights of science, our requirements are met by nature only.
        Nature is a boon given to us, as it protects crores and crores of organisms living on the earth. It gives us
        forests which are the lungs of Earth.<br>
        <mark>Challenges of Nature:</mark>
        Our lives as human beings started on this planet Earth and since then we are exhausting its resources. But,
        in
        return, we are exposing it to the external threats of destruction and mistreatment. Due to this, beautiful
        forests have been destroyed, rivers have been polluted and vast open lands have been consumed for buildings
        and
        factories. <del>>We are giving challenges to nature by doing activities as hunting down animals, cutting down
            trees,
            releasing poisonous gases and polluting rivers.</del>
        Our earth is literally experiencing many strokes of destructive activities due to which the river sources
        are
        going dry, plants are dying as well as species are eliminating.<mark> Today’s world is facing the biggest
            problem
            of
            ‘global warming’, which has a serious impact on our environment.</mark> So we all think seriously about
        our
        activities
        and help to bring such situations under control.
        Conservation of Nature
        Conservation of nature is another important issue. Although governments are employing various means to
        conserve
        nature, individuals must also come forward to contribute to saving nature. Therefore, everyone must do the
        tree
        plantation, restricting the use of paper, stopping wastage of water and electricity. Not only these we have
        to
        stop ill practices like the hunting of animals. Also, we must go for rainwater harvesting systems. If each
        one
        of us contributes their own bit, the difference will be tremendous for nature. The beginning of life, as
        well as
        the continuation of life on earth both, are a very complex process of nature. Every organism is important
        for
        the conservation of nature.<br>
        <b> Conclusion:</b>
        In the end, I would just say that please don’t keep my words to yourself only. <q>I request all to spread the
            message around so that every person can become a responsible global citizen who can contribute to saving our
            planet.</q>

        Also, focus on energy consumption. Therefore, switch off the power button, if no one is in the room. Do not
        use
        <small> personal vehicles, and follow public transportation. We can even use bicycles for small distances to
            protect
            your environment. Thus, through these simple yet effective measures, everyone can contribute greatly towards
            saving our mother nature from further exploitation.</small>

        <strike> Thanks!</strike>
